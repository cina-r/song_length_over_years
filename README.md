# song_length_over_years 
I analyzed the lengths of approximately 180,000 songs released between 1970 and 2021. The figure shows the average song length for each year.

A clear turning point emerges: up to 2011, average song length fluctuates without a discernible long-term trend. From 2011 onward, however, average song length decreases roughly linearly.

So what changed in 2011? In July of that year, Spotify launched in the U.S. and began its rapid rise in popularity. As is well known, Spotify and other streaming platforms pay artists per stream, with a stream counting once it exceeds a relatively short minimum duration. This creates an incentive to release shorter – and more numerous—tracks, which may help explain the observed decline in average song length.
