# song_length_over_years
I've analyzed the length of ~180.000 songs published between 1970 and 2021. The graph shows the average song length for each year.   
  
You can identify a turning point: Until 2011, the average song length fluctuates and doesnâ€™t show a trend. Since 2011, the song length has been linearly decreasing.  
  
So, what happened in 2011? Well, in July that year, Spotify launched in the U.S. and began its exceptional success story. As you probably know, Spotify and other music streaming providers pay the artists a certain amount of money per stream, with a stream being creditable if it exceeds a relatively short period of time. Therefore, it's more profitable for the artists to release shorter (and more) songs.
